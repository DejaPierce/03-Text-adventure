# 03-Text-adventure
My first text adventure game for game technology. My game is about an 8 year old boy who lost his parents while on a camping trip. The boy looks around to see where his parents are. He notices a mysterious cave and remembers that his parents went into the cave. He doesn't know why his parents would do such a thing. The little boy is scared at first, but he goes into the cave anyways to find his parents. 
I tried my best to layout what the game was suppose to do, but it won't go from the starting location to the next location.

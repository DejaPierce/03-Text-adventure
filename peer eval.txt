What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 That you able to have multiple games using the same python engine at once.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

The way the locations were classified and then have their descriptions seperate from the user commands. It seems more organized but also a little more effort. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 I am still struggling to run the game as whenever I type an option of which game I would like to play it just asks me again which game I would like to play. Tried numbers and that crashes it so I'm not sure what I am doing wrong.

I can't figure out what is wrong with the game not starting.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 What you are supposed to type to select the game.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The actual json file for the game seems well written and makes a lot of sense for the layout of the locations.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 yes

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 It has a good description of the story of the game but maybe talk more about specific things you did in the code.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I like the story a lot its pretty creppy and creative. Also the organization of json file is cool but maybe that's is whats confusing the code? I'm not sure but good job!
